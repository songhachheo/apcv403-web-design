			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				I have a passion for technology and the ability to adapt to new
				things quickly. I am constantly pushing myself to learn new
				skills. Being able to apply multiple coding languages such as
				Python, C#, C++, and JavaScript has allowed me to develop code
				for computer systems, application programs, and electronic
				firmware through school projects and even as a hobby.
